Starting a reference libary for html.css, js. .
So anyone can add to it.
I have found a difficult to find all the terms,code,and so on,
If you do add to this list, try to make it simple.  

<div></div> A div is a container to hold blocks of code. Place in in the body.
<!doctype html>
<html lang="eng">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<head/>
Inline Style Rule. This goes in the body. <h1 style=" color : yellow ; background : blue"> <!--text for style to be placed here--> hello i have code hidden here!</h1>  (This will make your <hi> text yellow with a blue background  text.) make sure you space your colons and semi colons.

External stylesheet. first open a html and a css file. Name files the same. paragraph.html & paragraph.css/ same directory.
Make sure you save them as .css and .html respective... at save as.... do not call file name paragraph.html or you will get paragraph.html.html  and so on.  I use WE-Builder    dreamweaver is more a step up and you have to learn the dam interface, so there is a large learning curve. Anyway it gets easier but it takes time.

<link type="text/css" rel="sylesheet" href=" <!-- here you would write paragraph.css media="screen">

link type="text/css---says link to my css page.  rel--- says i have a relationship with the .css file
href= says this is the path and the name. Because the path is the same directory it is easy and can be written this way.
media= screen--- says i am a color computer.  You can leave media screen out because it will default to that.

So if you have a html page with h1 tag in the body and you have text in the tag-- you can style it.
You would code-- h1 {color : yellow ; background : blue" } and save- or if you have auto refresh you can preview at your local host (local host is your computer) and you would see yellow text in a blue background.
<!-- this by the way is how to hide info that will not show up on screen-->
By the way---you need to place the link tage in the head under the title.

<h1> click code view to see the code you can not see here</hi> That is part of the fun!!

</body>
</html>
